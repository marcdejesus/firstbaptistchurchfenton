        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6">The Authority and Centrality of Scripture</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          First Baptist Church of Fenton demonstrates a profound commitment to the authority and centrality of Scripture in all aspects of church life and individual faith. The church explicitly identifies itself as a "Bible-Based Church", indicating their foundational belief that the Bible serves as the ultimate authority for faith and practice. This commitment is not merely theoretical but is evidenced through their practical approach to ministry and teaching.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The church's approach to preaching reflects their high view of Scripture. Their teaching philosophy centers on expositional preaching, which "seeks to declare the point of particular Biblical passages". This methodology demonstrates their belief that Scripture has inherent meaning and authority that must be carefully extracted and faithfully communicated rather than imposed upon by human interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6">The Gospel: Central Message of Scripture</h3>

        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The church provides a clear definition of the gospel, describing it as "the Bible's main message of God saving us through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ". This definition demonstrates several important theological convictions. First, they understand the gospel as the central theme that unifies all of Scripture. Second, they emphasize that salvation is God's work rather than human achievement. Third, they ground the gospel in specific historical eventsâ€”the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
