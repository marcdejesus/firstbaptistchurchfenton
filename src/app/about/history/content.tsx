At the founding meeting with eight men and eight women present, W. W. Booth was appointed secretary and Elder A. Lamb was installed as the church\'s first pastor. In these early years the congregation met in simple facilities, and Booth became a driving force in establishing Fenton\'s Baptist presence.'

The three-story stone seminary building became a local landmark and served the community for nearly two decades before being converted to a home for retired ministers.'
