History of the First Baptist Church of Fenton, Michigan
Founding and Early Years (1830s–1850)
Fenton, originally called Fentonville, was settled in the mid-1830s and saw its first churches established soon after. The first preaching in the village was by a Baptist minister (Elder Jones) in the late 1830s, with services held in a local home

. Local tradition even records a Baptist congregation as early as 1837

, though no formal church was yet organized. In those pioneer days, various itinerant preachers of different denominations shared makeshift venues – including a log schoolhouse and a community meeting hall built by town founder William Fenton – to hold worship services

. It was not until 1850, however, that the Baptists of Fentonville formally organized their own church. On January 5, 1850, First Baptist Church of Fentonville was constituted with a charter membership of 16 (eight men and eight women)

. Prominent local businessman William W. Booth was elected as the congregation’s first clerk/secretary, and Elder A. R. Lamb was installed as the first pastor

. Booth had settled in Fenton in 1849 and was instrumental in gathering the area’s Baptist believers together to start the church

. Notably, the village itself was still known as Fentonville at that time – it would not be incorporated and renamed Fenton until 1863

, so the church’s early records refer to it by the original town name. Under Elder Lamb’s leadership, the young church grew steadily. In 1856, Rev. John Booth – William Booth’s father and a veteran Baptist minister – took over as pastor of the congregation

. The elder Booth’s guidance helped stabilize the flock in its first decades. Early meetings were initially held in an old schoolhouse on the north side of the Shiawassee River, but as the membership increased, the need for a dedicated space became clear. In 1857 the Baptists began meeting in a hall on LeRoy Street (built by a local citizen, David Latourette) on Fenton’s main street. This served as the church’s home for about a decade

. During these years, William W. Booth remained a pillar of the church – he not only kept the records and helped draft the Articles of Faith, but also contributed greatly to the wider community (founding The Fentonville Observer newspaper in 1853 and even serving in the Union Army during the Civil War)

Establishing a Permanent Church (1860s)
By the 1860s, First Baptist Church of Fenton had firmly established itself in the growing town. The congregation embarked on constructing a permanent church building in the late 1860s. In 1868, they completed a substantial stone church edifice at the northwest corner of South Walnut and East Ellen Streets in downtown Fenton
m.facebook.com
. This handsome stone church became the first dedicated house of worship owned by Fenton’s Baptist congregation. It featured an ornate interior for its time, including stained-glass windows memorializing the founding families (according to local accounts preserved at the Fenton Museum). The stone church served the congregation for many decades and was a local landmark. Over the ensuing years, improvements were made to the stone church. In December 1886, for example, a new 1,500-pound bell was hung in the steeple – reputedly the largest bell in town – whose “mellow tones” called the community to worship each week. (This same bell would later be transferred to the church’s next location and continues to ring on special occasions.) The church’s records from the late 19th century show a community thriving both spiritually and materially. An annual report for 1894 detailed church expenditures for current expenses, benevolence, a relief fund, and even insurance

. By that year the membership had grown into the several hundred. In 1897, the Baptist Church became one of the first buildings in Fenton to take advantage of modern utilities – it arranged to be heated by steam supplied from the Fenton Electric Light & Power Company’s plant, replacing its old coal boiler (an innovative setup for its day).
The Fenton Baptist Seminary and Ministers’ Home (1868–1910s)
During the late 19th century, the influence of Fenton’s Baptist congregation extended into education and regional ministry. In parallel with the church’s growth, Fenton became home to the Fenton Baptist Seminary – a private academy founded under Baptist auspices. Educator Rosina L. Dayfoot established this seminary in the 1860s as a college preparatory school (initially especially for young women)

. The seminary’s first building was a modest two-story frame structure, but around 1868 a grand three-story stone building was erected at 309 High Street to house the school
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
. The curriculum included business, languages, music, and even calisthenics
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
, and the seminary served as a feeder school for Kalamazoo College (a Baptist college in western Michigan). Fenton’s strong educational system – both public and private – became a point of pride for the town in this era
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
. Unfortunately, by 1886 the seminary encountered financial difficulties that forced it to close
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
. That year, the trustees offered the impressive High Street building and its grounds to the Baptist Ministers Aid Society. The property was accepted and converted into the Baptist Ministers’ Home, a charitable retirement home for aging Baptist pastors and their wives
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
. For roughly the next century, Fenton’s Baptist Ministers’ Home served clergy from across several Midwestern states. In fact, First Baptist Church of Fenton gained renown as the host church for this regional Ministers’ Home, which welcomed retired ministers from Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
. Each Sunday, a multi-seat carriage would arrive at the Fenton church carrying the residents of the Ministers’ Home so they could attend worship. The massive stone High Street building went through changes – a fire in 1899 destroyed its top floor and mansard roof, and it was rebuilt in 1900 in a modified two-story form
nara-media.s3.amazonaws.com
. It remained one of Fenton’s most prominent 19th-century structures. (After many decades of service, the old seminary/Ministers’ Home eventually fell into disuse by the late 20th century and was demolished around 2015, marking the end of an era. But its legacy – and the church’s role in regional Baptist history – is still remembered in Fenton.)

Pastoral Leadership and Denominational Changes (1870s–1950)
Throughout its history, First Baptist Church of Fenton has been led by a series of dedicated pastors – 23 senior pastors in its first 150 years, according to church records. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the pastorate changed hands many times as the congregation continued to mature. One especially notable minister was Dr. Stephen Northrop, who holds the distinction of serving twice as Fenton’s pastor (first from 1877–1882 and again in 1917–1918) and being the only one to die while actively pastoring the church (he passed away in 1918 during his second tenure). The fact that Dr. Northrop returned to lead the flock a second time decades after his first term attests to the enduring bond between the church and its shepherds. As the 20th century progressed, the church kept pace with broader shifts in American Protestantism. In 1950, First Baptist Church of Fenton joined the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC), affiliating with this fellowship of theologically conservative, autonomous Baptist churches. This move reflected the congregation’s alignment with the fundamentalist Baptist movement of that era, as many churches across the country were separating from more liberal denominations and forming new associations. By mid-century, First Baptist of Fenton had thus positioned itself within the evangelical Baptist mainstream, emphasizing biblical teaching and active missionary programs in line with GARBC ideals.
Growth and a New Church Home (1950s–1960s)
The post-World War II decades brought significant growth to Fenton and to its Baptist church. Under Pastor Rev. Lawrence Taylor (who served 1956–1961), the church expanded its programs and outreach. In 1961, Rev. J. Don Jennings became pastor, and during his tenure the congregation experienced such a consistent increase in attendance that the need for a larger facility became urgent. By the early 1960s, Sunday services were sometimes filled to capacity – records mention 350 children in Sunday School (in space designed for only 200) and peak Sunday morning attendances near 380 people, numbers that far exceeded what the old stone church could comfortably hold. The decision was made to construct an entirely new church building on a larger property to accommodate the growing membership and ministries. A building committee (including members William Cutler, Jack Eby, James Potts, and Pastor Jennings) was formed in 1961, and that same year the church purchased property at 860 North Leroy Street on Fenton’s north side
firstbaptistfenton.org
. Groundbreaking for the new facility took place on April 8, 1962, and construction moved quickly. The design of the new church was notably guided by a layperson – Don Peterson, an automotive engineer by trade – who had toured over 30 other church buildings to glean best design ideas for Fenton’s sanctuary and classrooms. The first services in the completed building were held in January 1963, and a dedication ceremony took place on January 20, 1963 to officially open the new church at 860 N. Leroy
firstbaptistfenton.org
. For the first time in a century, Fenton’s Baptist congregation had relocated from the downtown site – the modern building provided ample seating, educational space, parking, and room for future expansion. (One cherished item from the old 1868 church made the move with them: the big church bell from the stone steeple was carefully removed and installed in the new building’s belfry, where it continues to be rung on special occasions, linking the new site with the congregation’s historic past.) The mid-1960s saw further expansion of the new facility. In October 1964, construction began on a 5,000 square-foot educational wing addition, which was completed by March 1965. This wing added numerous classrooms and educational amenities to support the church’s vibrant Sunday School and midweek programs for all ages. By the end of the 1960s, First Baptist Church of Fenton had a spacious modern campus and was well-positioned to serve the spiritual needs of a growing suburban community. Leadership during this transitional period continued to evolve. Rev. Jennings, having overseen the successful building project, eventually moved on to other ministry, and in 1967 Pastor Glenn Essenburg was called as senior pastor (serving until 1971). He was followed by Dr. Wilbur E. Henke, who became pastor in October 1972. Dr. Henke would lead the church for the next 14 years (until November 1986), a period of energetic growth and new initiatives.
Expansion of Ministries (1970s–1990s)
Under Dr. Henke’s ministry, First Baptist Church of Fenton expanded its footprint and programs significantly. In 1978, the church broke ground on a new gymnasium/recreation hall and additional classrooms, a project aimed at enhancing fellowship and educational space for the congregation. Along with this expansion, First Baptist Academy was founded in 1978 as a Christian day-school ministry of the church. The academy provided a Christian educational option for local families, reflecting the church’s ongoing commitment to teaching and discipleship. These developments in the late 1970s underscored the church’s role not just as a place of worship but as a weekday community center for learning, recreation, and outreach. By the late 1980s, the church had also achieved a major financial milestone. After carrying a mortgage from the building projects, the congregation was able to burn its mortgage on July 3, 1988 – symbolically celebrating the payoff of all building debt. A bond program initiated to fund earlier expansions was completed with an early redemption in September 1991, leaving the church debt-free moving into the 1990s. These achievements freed up resources for ministry and missions, and the church continued to invest in various programs (youth ministry, music, missions abroad, etc.). Over the years, a number of associate pastors and interns served the church in areas like music, youth, and outreach – names like Gerald Curneal, John Beatty, Jerry Beil, Ron Campbell, Brett Baker, Terry Roberts, Dan Cruver, Rob Miller, Joe Bordinaro, and others are remembered for their service alongside the senior pastors. One of them, Pastor Mike Briggs, joined the staff and by 2000 was serving as an assistant pastor in charge of music and outreach (it was Pastor Briggs who helped document much of the church’s rich history for its 150th anniversary). During this era, the congregation unfortunately witnessed the loss of its original 19th-century church building. The old stone church at Walnut and Ellen – which had stood vacant for decades after the move in 1963 – was deemed structurally unsafe and demolished in 1998. Church members searched the demolition site for the 1868 cornerstone, hoping to preserve a memento, but were unable to locate it. A few stone blocks were salvaged and brought to the new church as tokens of heritage, and some other artifacts (such as pieces of the stained glass windows bearing founders’ names) were later recovered and put on display at the Fenton Historical Museum. The passing of the “old sanctuary” was bittersweet for long-time members, but it highlighted how far the church had come – from a frontier meeting in a log schoolhouse to a thriving modern congregation – and it reinforced their determination to carry their heritage forward. First Baptist Church entered the 1990s under the leadership of Pastor Dave Boillat, who had been called as senior pastor in 1987. Pastor Boillat continued the church’s tradition of strong biblical preaching and community engagement. Under his leadership, the church undertook a series of renovations to update and beautify the North Leroy facility – projects in the 1990s gave the lobby and auditorium a fresh look and maximized the available space, all “to glorify the God we worship,” as Pastor Boillat put it. By the end of the century, First Baptist Church of Fenton was a blend of old and new: a congregation with deep roots in the history of Fenton and Genesee County, yet equipped with modern facilities and forward-looking ministries.
Sesquicentennial Celebration and Recent Years (2000–Present)
In the year 2000, First Baptist Church of Fenton reached a milestone: 150 years of continuous ministry. The church celebrated its Sesquicentennial in May 2000 with special commemorative services and events. On Sunday, May 7, 2000, the congregation gathered for a day of remembrance and thanksgiving. Different services highlighted historical “memories and blessings,” with special music and guest speakers. Dr. Charles Ware, president of Baptist Bible College in Indianapolis, was the keynote speaker for the celebration. In true Baptist fashion, the church family also enjoyed a festive fellowship meal – the annual “Ken’s Famous Chicken Dinner,” named after long-time member Ken Kispaugh who for years had barbequed chicken over an open pit for the entire congregation on special occasions. The old church bell, cast in the 19th century, pealed in celebration of 150 years of God’s faithfulness as members reflected on their rich heritage. As part of the Sesquicentennial, historical facts were shared: since 1850, the church had been served by 23 senior pastors; Dr. Northrop was remembered as the only pastor to die in office; the congregation had weathered wars, economic depressions, and many social changes yet remained steadfast. The anniversary was not only a time to look back but also to cast a vision forward. Pastor Boillat, then 13 years into his ministry at Fenton, emphasized the continuing mission of the church – to reach the community with the gospel and to “teach, grow, belong, and serve,” as the church’s motto came to express

. In the 21st century, First Baptist Church of Fenton continues to be an active presence in the region. The church remains at its North Leroy Street campus and still rings the old bell, a tangible link to the past. In recent years, leadership has transitioned to a new generation. After Pastor Boillat’s lengthy tenure (he served into the 2000s), the church called Pastor James Bell as its senior pastor. Under Pastor Bell, the church has maintained its commitment to biblical teaching and community outreach. The congregation has been involved in cooperative efforts like the “Love Our City” events alongside other local churches

, exemplifying its engagement in the wider Fenton/Linden/Holly area Christian community. As of 2025, First Baptist Church of Fenton remains a “Bible-based church” focused on Christ and known for warm hospitality and service
firstbaptistfenton.org
firstbaptistfenton.org
. Weekly worship and ministries continue to bring together people of all ages, just as they have for generations. From its humble start in a frontier village to its thriving ministries today, First Baptist Church’s history has been closely intertwined with the history of Fenton, Michigan. It has witnessed the town’s evolution from “Fentonville” crossroads to a modern city, and it has contributed to the region’s story – through educating youth at the seminary, caring for retired pastors at the Ministers’ Home, and providing spiritual guidance to countless families. The church’s journey – over 175 years of Baptist presence (and 173 years since official organization) – reflects a legacy of faith and community service. As Fenton’s oldest Baptist congregation, First Baptist Church continues to honor its rich heritage while looking ahead to the future, striving to remain, in Pastor Bell’s words, “a place where Jesus is first, people are loved, and the gospel is center stage”
