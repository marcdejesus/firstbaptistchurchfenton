Our History (/about/history)

First Baptist Church of Fenton was founded in the late 1800s by a group of faithful believers with a vision to bring the gospel to a growing community. Since then, we’ve seen generations of families raised, ministries launched, and lives transformed.

Key Moments in Our Story:
	•	Founding in the 19th Century – A small gathering of believers began meeting for prayer, preaching, and community outreach.
	•	20th Century Growth – The church grew steadily and began ministering to children, youth, and families, eventually expanding the facility to meet new needs.
	•	2016 Renewal & Revitalization – Under Pastor James Bell’s leadership, FBC entered a new season of gospel-centered renewal, discipleship, outreach, and international missions.

Today, we remain committed to our local community while equipping national pastors and church leaders around the world.
	•	Growth in the 1900s with children’s, youth, and missions ministry.
	•	In 2016, Pastor James Bell became Lead Pastor, bringing renewed focus on discipleship, outreach, and global missions.

Meet Our Team

Pastor James – Lead Teaching Pastor

James Bell serves as the Lead Teaching Pastor of First Baptist Church of Fenton. His journey to faith is one marked by skepticism, struggle, and grace. Raised by a single mother and having grown up without a father, James carried deep wounds and questions about God, purpose, and identity. By the time he reached college, he identified as an atheist — hardened by pain, resistant to religion, and searching for truth in all the wrong places.

That all began to change after an head injury landed him in the hospital. A Christian visited him there — not with judgment, but with presence and compassion. That conversation led to months of honest dialogue, raw questions, and finally, a radical encounter with the gospel of Jesus Christ. What started as curiosity became conviction. James gave his life to Christ and was never the same.

After surrendering to the call of ministry, he and his wife, Susanna, moved to North Carolina to serve the homeless, lead inner-city ministries, and begin formal theological training. It was during that season God gave them a growing burden for broken people, burned-out believers, and spiritually dry churches — especially in James’s hometown region.

In 2016, Pastor James became the Lead Teaching Pastor of FBC Fenton, where he has faithfully preached God’s Word, shepherded the church through revitalization, and led a movement focused on gospel clarity, authentic relationships, and global mission.

He is known for his bold, raw, and transparent preaching, blending theological depth with real-life application. He doesn’t shy away from hard conversations. His messages are marked by vulnerability, honesty, and a deep conviction that Jesus is still in the business of healing the broken and building His church.

James is also the President of the Board at the Center of Hope, founder of the Pastors Connection Network, and leader of several regional and international ministry initiatives training pastors in Pakistan, India, and Thailand.

James and Susanna have five wild and wonderful boys: Titus, Timothy, Tatum, Toby, and Theo. He’s a devoted dad, a passionate leader, and a firm believer that the local church is still God’s plan A for transforming the world.

He also understands ministry pain — the unseen battles, betrayals, and burdens many pastors and families silently carry. This empathy drives his work with pastors around the world, creating safe places for leaders to rest, grow, and return to ministry with clarity and strength.

First off, thank you for all the work you’ve done on the site so far. It’s coming together really well, and we’re grateful for your effort in building something meaningful and functional for our church family and visitors.

I do have a few pieces of feedback that I hope will help fine-tune the site moving forward:

Design & Visual Feedback:
	•	Font Near the Logo: The font style currently used near the logo doesn’t quite reflect the tone we’re going for. It feels a bit disconnected from the overall look, and might benefit from a cleaner, more modern or timeless style.
	•	Homepage Image (Brown Bible): The brown Bible photo on the homepage doesn’t visually represent our church’s personality or energy. We’d prefer to feature actual photos of our congregation — real people, real community — rather than stock imagery. This helps build authenticity and connection.
	•	Logo & Placement: The logo and font placement currently feel slightly off or displaced. It may be worth considering a redesign or a cleaner version that fits better with the overall flow and feel of the site.
	•	Page Traffic & Readability: Several of the pages and tabs feel a bit cluttered or busy. It would be helpful to simplify and streamline the content on each page, ensuring it’s clean, clear, and easy to read — especially for first-time visitors who need quick clarity.

I’m totally fine if some of this has to be implemented after the initial site launch — just wanted to get it on your radar for possible revisions. Thanks again for your flexibility and willingness to work with us to make this the best it can be!"
