      "prompt": "Please update the homepage content located at `src/app/page.tsx`. Based on the client's content document, you need to: 1. Change the main hero section's headline to: 'No matter where you've been, you're welcome here. Come as you are and discover the hope, truth, and grace of Jesus Christ.' 2. Ensure the following calls-to-action are prominently displayed on the homepage: 'Plan a Visit', 'Watch a Sermon', 'Get Involved', 'Give Online', and 'Contact Us'. 3. The client has provided feedback that the current hero image (a brown Bible) does not represent their community. For now, replace it with a placeholder image or a high-quality, relevant stock photo of a welcoming church community. Also, address the feedback about the font near the logo feeling disconnected; suggest and implement a cleaner, more modern or timeless font for the navigation/header area."

      "prompt": "The client has provided feedback about the website's design and readability. Please address the following points globally: 1. 'Logo & Placement': Review the logo's placement in the header (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`). The client feels it's 'slightly off or displaced'. Adjust the layout to improve its integration and alignment with the navigation. 2. 'Page Traffic & Readability': The client feels some pages are 'cluttered or busy'. Review the primary pages (Homepage, About, Visit) and apply UX principles to improve readability. This may involve increasing white space, improving typography hierarchy, and ensuring a clear visual flow. Refactor components to be cleaner and more focused. For example, break down large text blocks into smaller, more digestible sections with clear headings."
