# Backend Implementation Plan

## Current Status
-   **Initial Cleanup**: The `docs` directory has been cleaned of unnecessary files.
-   **Frontend Documentation**: A `README.md` file has been created in the `src` directory to document the frontend architecture and conventions.
-   **Implementation Plan**: This plan has been created to outline the backend development tasks.
-   **Next Steps**: The next phase is to begin the **Phase 1 (Foundation)** tasks, starting with the database and authentication setup. No backend code has been implemented yet.

## 1. Prerequisites & Setup

-   **Database Choice**: Decide on a database. Given the existing Firebase setup (`src/lib/firebase.ts`), Firestore is a strong candidate. It's a NoSQL database that integrates well with Firebase Authentication and other Firebase services.
